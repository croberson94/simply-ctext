# simply-ctext
A text editor built using the C programming language that provides a convenient way to create/modify local files.

## Overview
Originally, this project was a way for me to enhance my C programming skills, seeing as how often I use the C language in combination with other text editors. 
This editor acts as a modification of [Snaptoken's kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/), which is itself an extension of [Antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108). 

## Features
* Raw Input and Output
* Text Viewer
* Text Editor
* Search Mode
* Syntax Highlighting

## Installing
1. Download the files
	* You can dowload the files through the Github by cloning to your repository or direct zip download

2. Execution
	* After downloading the files/folder, use a c compiler program (ex. Cygwin gcc package), and within the terminal execute operation with the term 'make' to create the .exe file
	* Type the term './kilo' to enter the editor for a blank file, or './kilo 'filename'' (where filename represents the name of your existing filename and its path extension) to modify an existing file
