# simply-ctext
A text editor built using the C programming language that provides a convenient way to create/modify local files.

## Overview
Originally, this project was a way for me to enhance my C programming skills, seeing as how often I use the C language in combination with other text editors. 
This editor acts as an modification of [Snaptoken's kilo](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/), which is itself an extension of [Antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108).
